# Project-3 Title: Visualize Me - Stocks

### Team members:

* Luciano
* Mano

### Synopsis:

Extracting the stock data of 50 US companies with 10 years of data by different sectors and store it in MongoDB. We are joining the data with the exchange rate to display the results in one another currency. We are using our previous project for the data portion but loading it in MongoDB.

We are building a Dashboard that will have at least three visualizations to present the data sourcing from MangoDB:

1. Candlestick chart: We are going to present the trend (Max and min price) of a particular ticker month by month
2. Line chart: that shows the trend of the difference (Max and Min)
3. Slick.js will be used to create a scrolling display with a custom message - Example Best and worst performing ticker
